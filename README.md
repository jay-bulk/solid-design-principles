# solid-design-principles
Solid design principles written in various languages for practical application

## Practical application of best practice design principles.
The intent of this repo is to provide simple examples of best practice design principles.
Planned iterations:
* v.0: an example in one langauge for every design principle
* v.1: an example in several common languages
* v.2: code sandbox available (via example runkit.io) to run the code smaples
* v.3: code sandbox for all demonstrated languages
* v.4?: testing examples?

todo: caching principle
